# Core tenets of development
YAGNI - you aren't going to need it. move fast and don't optimize early. get feedback and iterate

## Postman collection
https://alec0xffffff.postman.co/workspace/Sous~31051643-2570-4176-bbd4-74c1136cdd66/collection/11148794-d546ac83-4c14-4a1a-9faa-23d3c674cac6?action=share&creator=11148794

## Testflight
- email alec@0xffffff.codes for access to the testflight app

## ROADMAP
- allow users to use without creating account and only force account creation once they're hooked?
- overview of how to use
- once user submit's something ask them to share--referral flywheel
- text preview should be enticing of try this restaurant or look what i ate
- email and text for account reset
- email for confirmation they joined

## Feature requests
- individual dishes, drinks, wines, all check-in-able from restaurants
- sort by city

### how it should work

Views:

  - look up restaurants (search location based)
    - link reservations and take out order
- capture
  - user can log meal (pick existing items or add new ones)
    - tag/invite other users in the meal
    - generate an IG story/post
  - log a menu
  - create a restaurant
  - log just an item
